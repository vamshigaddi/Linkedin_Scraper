      "1: I applied to over 200+ internships and jobs this Fall recruiting season. Out of all those applications, I secured around 10-15 interviews\n",
      "\n",
      "Job hunting is a numbers game, but I've learned there's so much more to it than that—especially when it comes to standing out in a sea of cold applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the biggest breakthroughs in my job search? 𝐎𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐦𝐲 𝐫𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐦𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐓𝐒.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ATS refers to the automated tracking system recruiters use to help filter/manage candidates, which can play a big role in whether or not your application moves forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the beginning, I had a hard time getting interviews, but everything changed once I learned about ATS and how it reviews resumes. I spent hours reading blogs, watching videos, and learning how to adjust my resume to fit what these systems look for. The impact was huge—suddenly, I started getting way more interview calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "A huge thank you toSir,Sir, andSir—their free content on YouTube was invaluable in understanding how ATS works and how to craft a resume that gets through. Their insights are helping many people like me navigate the recruitment process with confidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used this website to check and improve my resume score.\n",
      "[]\n",
      "\n",
      "Comment below if you’ve used other websites to improve your resume!\n",

      "\n",
      "When I started my journey in Machine Learning (ML), it felt like there was a lot to learn, and I wasn’t sure where to begin. But after some trial and error (and plenty of mistakes), I discovered a few key skills that accelerated my progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are 5 things I wish I had known earlier, and how they helped me get ahead:\n",
      "\n",
      "𝐔𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐁𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐜𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐇𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠:\n",
      "It might sound simple, but getting comfortable with data wrangling was a game-changer for me. Whether you're dealing with messy datasets or just figuring out how to clean and preprocess data properly, mastering tools like Pandas and Numpy helped me save lots of time and improved my results drastically.\n",
      "\n",
      "𝐁𝐮𝐢𝐥𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐬, 𝐍𝐨𝐭 𝐉𝐮𝐬𝐭 𝐅𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐓𝐮𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐚𝐥𝐬:\n",
      "Early on, I got stuck in the cycle of completing tutorials without actually applying what I learned. The real breakthrough came when I started building my own projects—no matter how small. Working on real-world problems, even if it’s something simple like predicting house prices or classifying images, gave me the hands-on experience I needed to really understand concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐦𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐒𝐤𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐬:\n",
      "Now, this is the one that might surprise you! I realized that no matter how technically sound I was if I couldn’t communicate my findings, and results clearly to non-technical stakeholders, it held me back. Learning how to present my work in a way that anyone could understand made a huge difference, especially in interviews. Explaining complex ideas simply is a superpower!\n",
      "\n",
      "𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐨 𝐅𝐚𝐢𝐥 𝐅𝐚𝐬𝐭:\n",
      "Not every model will work, and that’s okay. I used to spend too much time tweaking things that didn’t matter. Once I adopted the mindset of “failing fast” and iterating quickly, I started progressing much faster. It’s about trying new things, learning what doesn’t work, and moving forward.\n",
      "\n",
      "𝐔𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐁𝐢𝐠𝐠𝐞𝐫 𝐏𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞:\n",
      "Lastly, I realized it’s not just about building models—it's about understanding where ML fits into the broader business or industry context. Asking questions like “How does this model solve a real problem?” or “What impact will this have on the user?” helped me create solutions that mattered and added value beyond a good accuracy score.\n",
      "3: Why most people fail at learning to code—and what you can do differently!\n",
      "\n",
      "When I first started learning to code, I was terrified. I didn't know where to begin, and that fear kept me from moving forward. Like many others, I made the classic mistake of binge-watching tutorials on YouTube, thinking I had \"learned\" programming. But when it came time to write even a single line of code, I was completely lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "But then, I figured out what was holding me back and finally learned how to code.\n",
      "Here’s what worked for me, and I hope it helps anyone else in the same situation:\n",
      "\n",
      "𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐭𝐞𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐅𝐮𝐧𝐝𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐬: Whether it’s Python, Java, or C—start with the basics. Read and practice until you’re confident in the core concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "𝐔𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐛𝐥𝐞𝐦 𝐁𝐞𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐘𝐨𝐮 𝐂𝐨𝐝𝐞: Before diving into writing code, focus on how to write pseudocode, create flowcharts, and design algorithms for problems. These steps will make your life so much easier when you start coding.\n",
      "\n",
      "𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐭 𝐒𝐦𝐚𝐥𝐥, 𝐓𝐡𝐞𝐧 𝐒𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐞: Begin by building small projects in your chosen language. Once you're comfortable, move on to bigger projects. You’ll naturally pick up more advanced concepts as you go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some resources that helped me along the way:\n",
